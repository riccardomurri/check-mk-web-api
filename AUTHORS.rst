.. note::

   This *cmkclient* library builds upon the `check_mk_web_api`_ code written
   by `Max Brenner`_; up to release 1.6, basically all code comes from Max'
   repository, and I have only added some sugaring on top.  Any bug and change
   introduced after changing the name to ``cmkclient`` is, of course, my own
   fault. (*RM*, 2020-04-01)
